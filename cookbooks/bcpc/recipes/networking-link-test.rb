    # Run tests

    # There is no test for the management network. It must be up if we can
    # Chef it

    #
    # Test that we can ping at least one storage network peer.
    #
    # The aim of this test is to help during initial cluster build, when
    # the network may not have been debugged. We do not want to join
    # cluster members to the existing cluster unless they have the full
    # complement of network links
    #
    # Later on, however, if perhaps there have been some failures, we do
    # not want to prevent recovery by preventing chef from running in
    # scenarios we can't anticipate. Therefore this test disables itself
    # once it has passed once. To re-enable, simply remove the success
    # file by hand
