# This script must restart any services that connect (as clients) to the VIP
# since those connections will hang if this node was the previous VIP-holder
# and is now no longer (the connections usually never get broken so the
# clients never attempt to reconnect until some app-specific idle timeout
# kicks in)

# Restart the fluentd logging daemon
service td-agent restart

# Restart the diamond service 
service diamond restart

# Restart the Zabbix agent
service zabbix-agent restart

# Restart the powerdns service
service pdns restart

# Restart the openstack services that connect to the VIP
